## Introduction

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r Introduction}
summary(cars)
```
rationale and stakeholders for the project

## The rationale and stakeholders for the project

Research questions:
What factors influence fuel prices?

    [to discuss]
    [to discuss]
    [to discuss]

Stakeholders:

    Consumer
    Large refiner's
    Petrol stations
    NRMA
    Roads & Maritime (if we incorporate public transport).
    ACCC could be a stakeholder.
    Treasury
    Welfare groups

```{r Rationale}
summary(cars)
```


## The range of datasets examined as well as those chosen for the analysis (include details about how you merged the different datasets and an assessment on whether the granularity of the data sources is sufficient to answer your research questions)

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r Data Selection}
library(tidyverse)
library(lubridate)
library(readxl)
library(knitr)
library(data.table)
library(dplyr)



# Import data
Fuel_Jul20<-as.data.frame(read_xlsx("Fuel_2019-2020\\Fuel_price_history_checks_july2020.xlsx",1,skip=2, col_names = TRUE))%>% fill(everything(), .direction = "down")

Fuel_Jun20<-as.data.frame(read_xlsx("Fuel_2019-2020\\Fuel_price_history_checks_june2020.xlsx",1,skip=2, col_names = TRUE))%>% fill(everything(), .direction = "down")

Fuel_May20<-as.data.frame(read_xlsx("Fuel_2019-2020\\Fuel_price_history_checks_may2020.xlsx",1,skip=2, col_names = TRUE))%>% fill(everything(), .direction = "down")

NSWPublicHoliday<- read.csv("Public_Holiday_2019-2020\\australian_public_holidays_2020.csv")%>% filter(Jurisdiction=="nsw")

NSWPublicHoliday$Date<- ymd(NSWPublicHoliday$Date)
NSWPublicHoliday<- NSWPublicHoliday%>% rename(date=Date)
str(NSWPublicHoliday)

## Combine Fuel May to Jul 20
Fuel_RAW<- rbind(Fuel_May20,Fuel_Jun20,Fuel_Jul20)
Fuel_RAW$PriceUpdatedDate<- dmy_hms(Fuel_RAW$PriceUpdatedDate)
Fuel_RAW$date <- as.Date(format(Fuel_RAW$PriceUpdatedDate, "%Y-%m-%d"))

## merge Fuel_RAW with public holiday
Fuel_All<- left_join(Fuel_RAW,NSWPublicHoliday,by="date")

```

## The regression modelling techniques to be employed

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r modelling}
summary(cars)
```

## any issues that you anticipate might arise in carrying out the project

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r issues}
summary(cars)
```

## Include an Appendix that contains code samples demonstrating the data acquisition and merger processes that you have used to date

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r Appendix}
summary(cars)
```
